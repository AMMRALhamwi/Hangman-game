# Hangman-game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. It features a welcoming popup with instructions, a visual hangman drawing that updates with wrong guesses, and interactive letter buttons for guessing the secret word. Players are guided by categories and can enjoy sound effects for success or failure.
